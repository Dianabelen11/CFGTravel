            London is a moder, vibrant city, full of awesome things to do whatever your age. 
            The capital’s world-famous museums, attractions and exhibitions are always worth a visit, 
            but in a city as big, sprawling and packed with history as London, there’s always many ways 
            to entertain yourself whatever your style.
            Some things you can do are:
            1. Harry Potter Walking Tour
                You can start by finding the famous platform 9 3/4 is located in Kings Cross Station. 
                Then when you join Harry Potter Walking Tour, you will get to discover the real Diagon Alley, 
                as well as many other places (and facts) related to Harry Potter.Follow in the footsteps of 
                Harry, Hermione and Ron and get to know the muggle world of London from a wizard perspective.
         

           
            2. Borrough Market
                Dating back to the thirteenth century, London’s oldest food market is a cornucopia of gourmet 
                goodies. It used to highlight British produce but nowadays you’ll find global traders and 
                street-food vendors: enjoy French confit-duck sandwiches, Ethiopian stews and scotch eggs 
                (elevated, of course).
