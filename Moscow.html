            You can visit Russia’s capital at any time of the year, whether it’s winter or summer. During winter you can witness beautiful winter tale, trees covered in snow and happy people ice skating on one of the biggest ice rinks in Moscow,
            in front of GUM on Red Square. In summer, you can enjoy your lunch, try Russian cuisine in the sunshine on one of the summer terraces, in the park or on the rooftop. There are a lot of places you can visit such as 
            museums, Tretyakov Gallery or Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts and other famous attractions. One of the most visited places is Red Square. You will see the Kremlin, St. Basil’s Cathedral, the State History Museum and 
            GUM (State department store), which will be a thrilling experience and it’s a must-see. In the evening, you can watch ballet or opera performance on the incredible stage at Bolshoi Theatre. For example, the Nutcracker will 
            leave you breathless.
