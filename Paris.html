            Paris is the center for fashion, beauty, culture and gastronomy. It is the so called “City of Lights”. You can feel its romantic atmosphere by going to the most famous attraction, the Eiffel Tower, especially to watch the sunset
            from the top. One of the most iconic places is the Louvre, everyone knows its famous glass pyramid and exhibitions, including The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci and Liberty Leading the People by Eugène Delacroix. 
            If you are an art lover, you should definitely visit this renowned museum. Furthermore, Notre Dame de Paris is one of the oldest Gothic Cathedrals in the world and one of the best-known. Visitors can climb up
            to the two towers to see the incredible view of Paris. You should also try the French cuisine, there are a lot of Michelin star restaurants in Paris, but you can also enjoy your lunch on a café patio trying Escargots (snails), 
            Foie gras or French cheese. The best place to eat breakfast is to go to boulangeries and patisseries to try croissants and other delicious pastries. If you enjoy shopping and you would like to look like the stylish Parisians, 
            you can go to the Galeries Lafayette or to Avenue des Champs-Elysées.
